# Stock-Market

This was my very first computer science project. In this assignemnt I had to apply what I had learned thus far to make a software-application that would track stock data and allow the user to manipulate the data. The user can view the stock statistics, add or remove a stock, and export the data into a seperate file.

The assignment has been tweaked since I had turned it in, the most notable changes are from using JOptionPane to using the Terminal. Making sure the user could input whatever file they want as long as it follows the exceptions. Both the original and new project are in this repository. 

This project was for CIS240 - Application and Design.
